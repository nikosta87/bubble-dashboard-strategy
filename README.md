# Bubble Card Dashboard Strategy

A Home Assistant dashboard strategy that automatically generates an area-based dashboard using [Bubble Card](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card).

This project is built for people who want a clean Bubble Card dashboard without manually creating every room view, button, and navigation element. It reads your Home Assistant areas, devices, and entities, then creates a generated Lovelace dashboard from that structure.

## Features

- Automatic dashboard generation from Home Assistant areas
- One app-like Home view
- Room overview pop-up
- One generated pop-up per area
- Bubble Card controls for lights, switches, covers, climate entities, media players, selects, scripts, scenes, and more
- Footer navigation using Bubble Card's `horizontal-buttons-stack`
- Optional entity and domain filtering
- HACS custom repository support

## Requirements

- Home Assistant with dashboard strategy support
- [Bubble Card](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card) installed
- Areas configured in Home Assistant
- Devices and entities assigned to areas

Bubble Card is required. This strategy generates `custom:bubble-card` cards, but it does not install Bubble Card for you.

## Installation

### HACS Custom Repository

1. Open Home Assistant.
2. Go to **HACS**.
3. Open the three-dot menu and select **Custom repositories**.
4. Add this repository:

   ```text
   https://github.com/nikosta87/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy
   ```

5. Select **Dashboard** as the repository category.
6. Download **Bubble Card Dashboard Strategy**.
7. Reload Home Assistant or refresh your browser.

After installation, HACS should add the dashboard resource automatically. If you need to add it manually, use:

```text
/hacsfiles/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy.js
```

Resource type:

```text
JavaScript Module
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download `bubble-card-dashboard-strategy.js` from the `dist/` folder.
2. Copy it to your Home Assistant `www` folder, for example:

   ```text
   /config/www/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy.js
   ```

3. Add the resource in Home Assistant:

   ```yaml
   lovelace:
     mode: storage
     resources:
       - url: /local/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy.js
         type: module
   ```

4. Restart Home Assistant or reload the frontend.

## Create A Dashboard

1. Go to **Settings** → **Dashboards**.
2. Create a new dashboard.
3. Open the dashboard.
4. Enter edit mode.
5. Open the three-dot menu and select **Raw configuration editor**.
6. Add:

   ```yaml
   strategy:
     type: custom:bubble-card-dashboard
   ```

7. Save the dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### Timeout waiting for strategy element

If Home Assistant shows this error:

```text
Timeout waiting for strategy element ll-strategy-dashboard-bubble-card-dashboard to be registered
```

the JavaScript resource was not loaded correctly.

Check **Settings** → **Dashboards** → three-dot menu → **Resources** and make sure this resource exists:

```text
/hacsfiles/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy.js
```

The resource type must be:

```text
JavaScript Module
```

If you installed manually, use your `/local/...` path instead.

Also try:

- hard-refreshing the browser
- clearing the browser cache
- removing duplicate or old resources for this strategy
- downloading the repository again in HACS
- restarting Home Assistant

## Configuration

Basic example:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:bubble-card-dashboard
```

Example with options:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:bubble-card-dashboard
  title: My Home
  max_entities_per_area: 24
  ignored_domains:
    - sensor
  ignored_entities:
    - light.unused_light
```

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | string | Home Assistant location name | Dashboard title |
| `max_entities_per_area` | number | `24` | Maximum number of generated entity cards per area |
| `ignored_domains` | string[] | `[]` | Domains to exclude from generated room views |
| `ignored_entities` | string[] | `[]` | Specific entities to exclude |

## How It Works

The strategy uses the Home Assistant area, device, and entity registries to build the dashboard. The overview page links to generated room views. Each room view contains Bubble Card controls for supported entities assigned to that area.

Hidden and disabled entities are ignored automatically.

The generated dashboard uses Bubble Card pop-ups:

- `#rooms` opens the room overview
- `#room-{room-name}` opens a generated room detail pop-up
- room pop-ups contain a **Back to rooms** button
- the footer's first button opens `#rooms`; it does not navigate to `/lovelace/home`
- the horizontal button stack is placed as the last card in the view, as required by Bubble Card

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the strategy:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled file is written to:

```text
dist/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy.js
```

## Roadmap

- Graphical strategy editor
- Room pop-ups
- Better domain grouping for lights, climate, security, media, and covers
- Label-based filtering
- Bubble Card theme variables
- More customizable overview sections
