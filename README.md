# Bubble Card Dashboard Strategy

A Home Assistant dashboard strategy that automatically generates an area-based dashboard using [Bubble Card](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card).

This project is built for people who want a clean Bubble Card dashboard without manually creating every room view, button, and navigation element. It reads your Home Assistant areas, devices, and entities, then creates a generated Lovelace dashboard from that structure.

## Features

- Automatic dashboard generation from Home Assistant areas
- One app-like Home view
- Top navigation bar using Bubble Card sub-buttons
- Room overview pop-up
- One generated pop-up per area
- Bubble Card controls for lights, switches, covers, climate entities, media players, selects, scripts, scenes, and more
- Optional entity and domain filtering
- HACS custom repository support

## Requirements

- Home Assistant with dashboard strategy support
- [Bubble Card](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card) installed
- [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod) installed if you want all Home overview cards to use the same fixed height
- Areas configured in Home Assistant
- Devices and entities assigned to areas

Bubble Card is required. This strategy generates `custom:bubble-card` cards, but it does not install Bubble Card for you.

## Installation

### HACS Custom Repository

1. Open Home Assistant.
2. Go to **HACS**.
3. Open the three-dot menu and select **Custom repositories**.
4. Add this repository:

   ```text
   https://github.com/nikosta87/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy
   ```

5. Select **Dashboard** as the repository category.
6. Download **Bubble Card Dashboard Strategy**.
7. Reload Home Assistant or refresh your browser.

After installation, HACS should add the dashboard resource automatically. If you need to add it manually, use:

```text
/hacsfiles/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy.js
```

Resource type:

```text
JavaScript Module
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download `bubble-card-dashboard-strategy.js` from the `dist/` folder.
2. Copy it to your Home Assistant `www` folder, for example:

   ```text
   /config/www/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy.js
   ```

3. Add the resource in Home Assistant:

   ```yaml
   lovelace:
     mode: storage
     resources:
       - url: /local/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy.js
         type: module
   ```

4. Restart Home Assistant or reload the frontend.

## Create A Dashboard

1. Go to **Settings** → **Dashboards**.
2. Create a new dashboard.
3. Open the dashboard.
4. Enter edit mode.
5. Open the three-dot menu and select **Raw configuration editor**.
6. Add:

   ```yaml
   strategy:
     type: custom:bubble-card-dashboard
   ```

7. Save the dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### Timeout waiting for strategy element

If Home Assistant shows this error:

```text
Timeout waiting for strategy element ll-strategy-dashboard-bubble-card-dashboard to be registered
```

the JavaScript resource was not loaded correctly.

Check **Settings** → **Dashboards** → three-dot menu → **Resources** and make sure this resource exists:

```text
/hacsfiles/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy.js
```

The resource type must be:

```text
JavaScript Module
```

If you installed manually, use your `/local/...` path instead.

Also try:

- hard-refreshing the browser
- clearing the browser cache
- removing duplicate or old resources for this strategy
- downloading the repository again in HACS
- restarting Home Assistant

## Configuration

Basic example:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:bubble-card-dashboard
```

Example with options:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:bubble-card-dashboard
  title: My Home
  profile_image: /local/profile.jpg
  show_camera_button: true
  media_player_card: bubble-card
  enable_sonos_grouping: true
  max_entities_per_area: 24
  ignored_domains:
    - sensor
  ignored_entities:
    - light.unused_light
```

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | string | Home Assistant location name | Dashboard title |
| `profile_image` | string | none | Optional image URL for the round avatar in the top navigation |
| `show_camera_button` | boolean | `true` | Shows or hides the camera icon in the top navigation |
| `media_player_card` | string | `bubble-card` | Media player card type. Use `bubble-card`, `mini-media-player`, or `yamp` |
| `enable_sonos_grouping` | boolean | `true` | Adds Mini Media Player speaker group controls for detected Sonos media players |
| `sonos_entities` | string[] | auto-detected | Optional list of Sonos `media_player` entities when auto-detection is not enough |
| `max_entities_per_area` | number | `24` | Maximum number of generated entity cards per area |
| `ignored_domains` | string[] | `[]` | Domains to exclude from generated room views |
| `ignored_entities` | string[] | `[]` | Specific entities to exclude |

### Graphical Editor

The dashboard includes a Home Assistant strategy editor, similar to the editor used by Simon42 Dashboard Strategy.

Open the dashboard, click the edit pencil, then open the dashboard edit dialog. The editor lets you configure:

- dashboard title
- profile image URL
- camera button visibility
- media player card type
- maximum generated entities per room

### Media Player Cards

The Home overview media card automatically chooses the best media player to show. It prefers currently playing players, then paused players, then the most recently updated media player with media metadata or artwork.

By default, media players are generated as Bubble Card media-player cards:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:bubble-card-dashboard
  media_player_card: bubble-card
```

You can use Mini Media Player instead:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:bubble-card-dashboard
  media_player_card: mini-media-player
```

This requires [Mini Media Player](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-media-player) to be installed separately.

When Mini Media Player is selected, the generated card uses `artwork: material`. If Sonos media players are detected, the strategy also adds Mini Media Player's `speaker_group` config:

```yaml
speaker_group:
  platform: sonos
  entities:
    - media_player.living_room
    - media_player.kitchen
  sync_volume: true
  show_group_count: true
```

You can disable this in the dashboard editor with **Sonos grouping**.

You can also use Yet Another Media Player:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:bubble-card-dashboard
  media_player_card: yamp
```

This requires [Yet Another Media Player](https://github.com/jianyu-li/yet-another-media-player) to be installed separately. The generated YAMP config uses its recently-played idle screen.

## How It Works

The strategy uses the Home Assistant area, device, and entity registries to build the dashboard. The overview page links to generated room views. Each room view contains Bubble Card controls for supported entities assigned to that area.

Hidden and disabled entities are ignored automatically.

The generated dashboard uses Bubble Card pop-ups:

- `#rooms` opens the room overview
- `#room-{room-name}` opens a generated room detail pop-up
- room pop-ups contain a **Back to rooms** button
- the footer's first button opens `#rooms`; it does not navigate to `/lovelace/home`
- the horizontal button stack is placed as the last card in the view, as required by Bubble Card

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the strategy:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled file is written to:

```text
dist/bubble-card-dashboard-strategy.js
```

## Roadmap

- Graphical strategy editor
- Room pop-ups
- Better domain grouping for lights, climate, security, media, and covers
- Label-based filtering
- Bubble Card theme variables
- More customizable overview sections
